## MH-WipePlayer
- With this you can easy wipe a player account if needed.
- I use it for cheaters or people that are very rude or bad, 
- why i do this is to let them know that there account is gone in just a few secs.
- even if they have played for many hours.
- 
- I have no mercy for cheaters



## How to install
- drop the folder `qb-wipeplayer` in `resources/[qb]`
- restart your server



## How it works
- To add a player to the wipe list type: `/wipe-list-player [player server id]`
- The next time this player joins the server, this account will be deleted automatically.
- 
- 
- You can also delete the player right away if this player is online at the moment.
- to delete a player right away type `/wipe-player [player server id]`
- 
- 
- You can also add a citizenid to the list
- to add a citizenid type `/wipe-add-citizenid [citizenid]`
- The next time this player joins the server, this account will be deleted automatically.



## NOTE
- The wipe list will automatically delete a account when this account is wiped.
